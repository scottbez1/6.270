Detects fiducial patterns.

Requires OpenCV to be installed.  See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide%20%3A%20Debian for details on building OpenCV for Ubuntu/Debian.

Compile this by running "make"

Run "./vid_squares [camera number]" which optionally takes a video device number.  There are 3 windows that open - a video window with robots overlayed, a thresholded/filtered video to see what video is being analyzed, and a control panel for setting things like the threshold brightness level or the tolerance for differences in side lengths (as a %).
