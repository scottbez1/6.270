Requires OpenCV to be installed.  See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide%20%3A%20Debian for details on building OpenCV for Ubuntu/Debian.  Those instructions are slightly out of date, so you'll have to change some of the package names to get them to install correctly.  After running "make install" I also had to run "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to get it to work, your mileage may vary.


Compile this by running "make"

Run "./vid_squares [camera number]" which optionally takes a video device number.  There are 3 windows that open - a video window with robots overlayed, a thresholded/filtered video to see what video is being analyzed, and a control panel for setting things like the threshold brightness level or the tolerance for differences in side lengths (as a %).
